# algver

An implementation of a linear regression-based framework for verification of Bayesian
inverse codes. This implementation attempts to verify the MCMC routines in the stochastic
library QUESO. The code is in rough shape and there seem to be some bugs, particularly with
the cases involving a Gaussian prior, so it should be used with caution. A forthcoming paper
will describe the framework in detail.
